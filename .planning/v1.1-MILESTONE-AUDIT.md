# v1.1 Enhanced Insights & Savings — Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.1 Enhanced Insights & Savings  
**Audited:** 2026-02-24  
**Status:** tech_debt (no blockers, accumulated cleanup items)

## Executive Summary

v1.1 milestone completed with a significant scope change:
- **Phases 7-8:** Built complete savings tracking and visualization system
- **Phase 9:** Removed all savings functionality (user decision to pivot)

All requirements were technically satisfied before Phase 9. The milestone now represents a complete feature lifecycle: build → evaluate → remove. No critical gaps remain; only cleanup debt from the removed feature.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
| SAV-01: System calculates cost savings from stop/start events | 7 | ✓ Complete → Removed | Built in P7, removed in P9 |
| SAV-02: Savings dashboard shows estimated vs projected costs | 7 | ✓ Complete → Removed | Built in P7-8, removed in P9 |
| SAV-03: Historical activity charts with 7d/30d/90d ranges | 8 | ✓ Complete → Removed | Built in P8, removed in P9 |
| SAV-04: Per-instance savings attribution | 8 | ✓ Complete → Removed | Built in P8, removed in P9 |
| SAV-05: Cost projection with disclaimer | 8 | ✓ Complete → Removed | Built in P8, removed in P9 |
| AUD-01: All cost calculations logged | 7 | ✓ Complete → Removed | Built in P7, removed in P9 |
| AUD-02: System stores hourly rate at stop event time | 7 | ✓ Complete → Removed | Built in P7, removed in P9 |

**Score:** 7/7 requirements satisfied (all built, then intentionally removed)

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Goal | Status | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| 7 | Core Savings Calculation & API | ✓ PASSED | 07-VERIFICATION.md (6/6 truths) |
| 8 | Dashboard & Visualization | ✓ PASSED | 08-VERIFICATION.md (6/6 truths) |
| 9 | Complete Savings Removal | ✓ PASSED | 09-VERIFICATION.md (5/5 truths) |

**Score:** 3/3 phases verified

## Integration Check Results

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard | ✓ Working | No savings dependency |
| Accounts | ✓ Working | No savings dependency |
| Instances | ✓ Working | No savings dependency |
| Schedules | ✓ Working | No savings dependency |
| Recommendations | ✓ Working | Uses estimated_daily_savings (independent of savings API) |
| Audit Log | ✓ Working | No savings dependency |

**Score:** 6/6 flows complete

### Build Verification

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Frontend TypeScript | ✓ Passes |
| Go Backend Build | ✓ Builds successfully |
| Docker Images | ✓ Rebuilt with fresh artifacts |
| /savings endpoint | ✓ Returns 404 (expected) |
| Navigation items | ✓ Shows 6 items (no Savings) |

## Tech Debt Inventory

The following items remain from the savings feature removal. None are blocking, but cleanup would reduce codebase size.

### Orphaned Files

| File | Type | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| `web/src/lib/formatters.ts` | Frontend utility | Can delete (no imports) |
| `deployments/docker/migrations/006_cost_tracking.sql` | Database migration | Keep (harmless, documents history) |
| `deployments/docker/migrations/004_missing_tables.sql` (savings table) | Database migration | Keep (harmless, documents history) |

### Orphaned Code

| Location | Item | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| `internal/models/models.go` | `Saving` struct | Can delete (unused) |
| `internal/models/models.go` | `DashboardStats.SavingsCents` field | Can remove field |

### Database Tables

| Table | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `savings` | Exists but unused | Keep for potential future use, or drop via migration |
| `savings_summary` materialized view | Exists but unused | Keep or drop via migration |

**Total:** 5 items across 3 files

## Recommendations

### Option A: Accept Tech Debt (Recommended)

The orphaned code is minimal and doesn't affect functionality. Accept and track in backlog:
- Migration files document project history
- Model structs are ~20 lines total
- formatters.ts is ~50 lines

Run `/gsd-complete-milestone v1.1` to archive.

### Option B: Plan Cleanup Phase

If a clean codebase is preferred, plan a quick cleanup:
- Delete `web/src/lib/formatters.ts`
- Remove `Saving` struct and `SavingsCents` field from models.go
- Optionally: add migration 007 to drop savings tables

Run `/gsd-plan-milestone-gaps` to create cleanup phase.
