### Checkpoint Details

**What was built:**
Complete Phase 1 multi-cloud discovery flow:
- AWS and GCP provider registration with account-specific keys
- Instance persistence to database with sync on discovery
- Connection status tracking per cloud account
- Sortable, filterable instances table with account column
- Connection status chips on cloud accounts page
- Skeleton loading and toast notifications
- Clickable dashboard stats with URL-based filtering
- Prominent CTAs for adding accounts

**How to verify:**

1. Start the server: `go run cmd/server/main.go` or use `docker-compose up app`
2. Start the frontend: `cd web && npm run dev` or use `docker-compose up frontend`
3. Open http://localhost:5173 (or http://localhost:3001 if using docker) in browser

**Test the following flows:**

**A. Add Cloud Account:**
1. Navigate to Cloud Accounts page
2. Click "Connect Account"
3. Add an AWS account with valid credentials
4. Verify account appears with "syncing" then "connected" status

**B. View Instances:**
1. Navigate to Instances page
2. Verify instances from your AWS account appear
3. Test sorting: click Name header, verify sort
4. Test filtering: select "Running Only", verify filter
5. Verify Account column shows account name

**C. Dashboard Navigation:**
1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Verify Running/Sleeping counts match instances
3. Click Running Databases card
4. Verify navigation to /instances?status=running
5. Verify instances are pre-filtered

**D. Error Handling:**
1. Try adding invalid credentials
2. Verify toast notification appears
3. Verify account shows "failed" status with error

**Expected outcomes:**
- Connection status chips show "connected" for valid accounts
- Instances table is sortable and filterable
- Dashboard stats cards are clickable and navigate correctly
- Toast notifications appear for errors
